<!-- This is where you will create your custom post types -->
<!-- These could be included in your functions.php directly but it makes it easier to read if you split it up so your functions.php isn't as long -->

<!-- - Cats will be a custom post type
- Enquiries (submitted comments through contact form) will be a custom post type -->
